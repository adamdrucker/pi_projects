# pi_projects
Python projects using IDLE on a Raspberry Pi 

* caesar.py is a classic Caeser cipher created from https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/secret-messages/1 with some modifications
* captcha.py generates a string of six (6) pseudo-randomly chosen characters from the sets: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9]  (in my mind I envisioned one of the CAPTCHA verification checks)
* finding_factors.py prints out a list of numbers that are factors of the input, or alerts you that input is a prime number
* otp_pk.py uses a One-Time Pad process with Caeser-based encryption to encrypt/decrypt messages
* qs2.py & qs3.py are for testing purposes related to another repo
* site_crypt.pt * sitecrypt_bottle.py are also related to another repo and are proto-scripts related to the Bottle project
